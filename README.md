<h1>Hello, welcome to my GitHub profile</h1>
<h2>My name is Lucas Machado and I'm a Junior developer</h2>
<p>A quick introduction: Hi, as I said before, my name is Lucas Machado; I'm  Brazilian and a self-taught professional.<br>
During the 2020 pandemic, I learned to program in Python by myself. Through this journey of learning the language,<br>
I became obsessed with technology and programming. Because of that passion, since 2023 I've been in Computer Science College,<br>
started this Journey on IFES(a federal stintution),but due locomotion problems I'm now studing in FAESA.<br>
Currently working in my first job at LAMPP-IT as a junior developer, I'm learning everything needed to become a full-stack developer.</p>
